# Event Management System
An event management system is a web application that allows events to be added, updated, deleted and viewed. It includes two types of users. One of these users is an admin and the other is a regular user. Normal users can only view and register events. Unlike normal users, admins can perform actions such as adding, deleting, updating events.
